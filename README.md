# **Image Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering**  

This project demonstrates image segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**. It groups similar pixel colors in an image and replaces them with their average color, resulting in a segmented representation of the image.  

---

## **Overview**  

Image segmentation is a fundamental technique in computer vision used to partition an image into meaningful regions. By clustering similar pixel values, we can simplify an image while retaining its core visual structure.  

This project focuses on color-based segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, which is both efficient and straightforward to implement.  

---

## **Key Features**  

- Segments images into a specified number of color groups.  
- Provides a side-by-side comparison of the original and segmented images.  
- Simple and easy-to-use Python implementation.  

---

## **Requirements**  

To run this project, ensure you have the following:  

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.  
- Required Python libraries, which can be installed via:  

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
  ```

## **How It Works**  

1. **Input Image:** The image is loaded and reshaped into a 2D array of pixel color values (RGB).  
2. **Clustering:** The K-Means algorithm groups the pixels into clusters based on their color similarity.  
3. **Reconstruction:** Each pixel is replaced with the average color of its cluster to form the segmented image.  
4. **Output:** Both the original and segmented images are displayed for comparison.

## **Getting Started**  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-segmentation-clustering.git
   cd image-segmentation-clustering
   ```  

2. **Place an Image:**  
   Save your target image in the project folder and name it `image.jpg`.  

3. **Run the Script:**  
   Execute the Python script to view the segmentation results.  

   ```bash
   python segment_image.py
   ```  

---

## **Example Output**  

- **Input:** Original image  
- **Output:** Segmented image with simplified color regions  

---

## **Customization**  

- Adjust the number of color clusters by modifying the `k` value in the script:  
  ```python
  k = 3  # Number of color clusters
  ```
